# Laboratory Work 10 — Frontend and Backend Integration Setup

## Task 1: Functional Requirements
A `requirements.md` is included summarizing the features derived from the mockups (list cars with paging/sorting/filtering, add/edit/delete row actions, export CSV).

## Task 2: Backend (Disable Security)
Use the provided `backend-snippet/SecurityConfig.java` to temporarily allow all requests.
- Build & run your backend.
- Verify `GET http://localhost:8080/api/cars` works without a token.

## Task 3: Frontend (carfront)
Create the React app (already scaffolded here) and verify the static AppBar renders.

### Run
```bash
cd carfront
npm install
npm start
```
